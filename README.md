# Youtube Comments Analyzer
Currently the focus of this project is to analyze youtube comments by counting all re-occurring words from all comments on a specific video.
You can also just return all comments including author, author profile pic, author channel link,  amount of likes and date published (see `src/examples` for syntax).
Note that this project doesn't use any API's to accomplish its goal.
